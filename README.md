# Identity Manager 

Identity management (ID management) is a broad administrative area that deals with identifying individuals in a system (such as a country, a network, or an enterprise) and controlling their access to resources within that system by associating user rights and restrictions with the established identity.

At the most basic level, identity management involves defining what users can do on the network with specific devices and under what circumstances. Today, many security products have an emphasis on managing mobile access to corporate systems. In an enterprise setting, identity management is used to increase security and productivity, while decreasing cost and redundant effort.

### IdentityServer is a framework and a hostable component that allows implementing single sign-on and access control for modern web applications and APIs using protocols like OpenID Connect and OAuth2. It supports a wide range of clients like mobile, web, SPAs and desktop applications and is extensible to allow integration in new and existing architectures.
